# React Native: Uncommon 'undefined is not an object' error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon 'undefined is not an object' error in React Native that occurs when accessing state/props before they are fully initialized.  The error is subtle and can be difficult to debug if you're not aware of the root cause.  The solution involves using conditional rendering or async/await to handle data fetching and state updates effectively.

## Problem

The bug.js file showcases the scenario where an attempt to access a prop or state variable is made before it has been populated. This leads to the frustrating 'undefined is not an object' error in the console.

## Solution

The bugSolution.js file demonstrates how to resolve this by incorporating safe conditional access or using techniques to ensure proper variable initialization before accessing them.
